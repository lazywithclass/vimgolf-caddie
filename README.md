Remember not to abuse this tool, it makes 2 requests to http://vimgolf.com, the last thing we want is to flood our beloved site, right?
In fact I might add a `-f` options in the future to force the fetch from the site, using a local html otherwise.

If something doesn't work properly please understand that I've written this in a couple hours, open a pull request and I'll be happy to fix.
